Palindrome Birthday App 

## Tasks: 
- Take your user's birthday
- Tell whether user was born on a palindrome day or not.
- You must use one of these formats to put dates eg: MM/DD/YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY, MM/DD/YY, etc. Having atleast one date-format out of these is mandatory, adding extra date formats is a bonus (optional). Make sure to check whether the date can be a palindrome date or not.
-  show the nearest palindrome date and by how many days the user has missed the palindrome date.
## Result :
Here I have used VanilaJs, HTML, and CSS.
